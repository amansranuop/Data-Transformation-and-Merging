# Data-Transformation-and-Merging
This project involved processing and merging daily Garmin data with monthly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) survey scores, which measure anxiety severity. The GAD scores were transformed from a long to a wide format and carried over for 30 days to align with the daily data.
